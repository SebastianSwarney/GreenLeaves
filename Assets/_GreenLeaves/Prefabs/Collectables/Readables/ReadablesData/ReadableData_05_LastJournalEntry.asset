  m_readableDescription: "Day: last\n\nMy leg, it\u2019s difficult just to write
    these words as I now only have two useful fingers. A group of furious boulders
    crashed down onto me and I had to crawl to where I am writing now. I fear the
    worst. The climb here is impossible under these conditions and no one will know
    of my being here until the next settler decides to make a similar journey, and
    I\u2019ve done my best to deter any souls from following. My thoughts race. I
    know not if finding gold would have filled my needs, I know only that my family
    alone occupies my mind. My wife\u2019s touch, my son\u2019s desire to be at my
    side at all times. What I would do"
