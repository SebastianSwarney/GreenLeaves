    anyone has ever stepped foot here before me. It\u2019s raining something awful
    and I am taking momentary shelter. I admit the mixture of the storm and unsettled
    rock makes me uneasy but I must move on. I need to provide for my wife, show
    my son that his father had a purpose in his life. There\u2019s a path just ahead
    and I can no longer outwait this storm. I <i>will</i> reach my prize."
