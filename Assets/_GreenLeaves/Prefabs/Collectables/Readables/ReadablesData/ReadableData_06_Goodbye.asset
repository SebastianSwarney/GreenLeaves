  m_readableDescription: "I am certain that you are the resident of this small home.
    Did you ever plan on returning? When you left I was only a boy, wondering why
    his father had to leave his family behind. You had a home, owned a business,
    you had us, what more did you need? I\u2019ve waited here for days and I will
    not repeat your mistakes, I have my family to think of. I\u2019m moving on, I
    hope you\u2019ve found what you were looking for.\r\n\n- Your Son"
